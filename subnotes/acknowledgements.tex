\section{Preface}
In this personal coverage note, I try to record some thought processes and learning results I obtained from watching lectures and videos about numerous machine learning literature or applications.
For now, the personal coverage note covers the following sections:

\subsection{COMPSCI 189: Introduction to Machine Learning}
This part covers the basic concepts of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and focuses specifically on statistical learning techniques.

\subsection{COMPSCI 285: Deep Reinforcement Learning}
This part covers fundamental knowledge regarding deep reinforcement learning, sampled from Sergey Levine's Deep Reinforcement Learning lecture.

\subsection{COMPSCI 294-158: Deep Unsupervised Learning}
This part covers fundamental knowledge regarding deep unsupervised learning, sampled from Pieter Abbeel's Deep Unsupervised Learning lecture.

\subsection{Mu Li's Videos on YouTube}
This part covers the notes I took from watching Mu Li's videos on YouTube, which covers a wide range of topics in machine learning.
